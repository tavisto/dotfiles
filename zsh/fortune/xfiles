Mulder: Do you believe in the existence of extra terrestrials?
Scully: Logically, I'd have to say no. Given the distances
	needed to travel from the far reaches of space the
	energy requirement would exceed a space craft's
	capabilities...
Mulder: Conventional wisdom, though when convention, and
	science offer us no answer might we not finally turn
	to the fantastic as a plausibility?
Scully: What I find fantastic is the notion that there are
	answers beyond the realm of science. The answers are
	there, you just have to know where to look.
Mulder: (sarcastically) That's why they put the 'I' in FBI!

Mulder: And maybe because I run into so many people who are

	their heads outweighs the millstone of humiliation.

Scully: It just doesn't seem, substantial enough to warrant an
	investigation.
Mulder: OK, Scully, so we disagree. It's not the first time,

Scully: Well, at least if we had a legitimate source, we could..
Mulder: This is the essence of science, you ask an impertinent
	question and you're on your way to a pertinent answer.
Scully: So, what makes this case any more credible than...
	(Scully picks up a copy of National Comet, a tabloid,
	off Mulder's desk and reads)....the hundred year old
	mother with the lizard baby?
Mulder: Because the lizard baby wasn't born anywhere near Lake
	Okobogee.

Ellen: 	And, of course, it helps if you can find a man.

Ellen: 	Yeah, they're disappearing faster than the Brazilian

Scully: You're in the basement because they know they could

Scully's voiceover at end: Addendum to case report. After his
	death, a diary was found along Gerald Schnauz's
	belongings written in the second person and apparently
	intended as an open letter to his father. It includes
	the names of his victims, the women he desired to save.
	My name is contained in the last entry. I have no
	further explanation for the existence of the
	photographs, nor am I confident one is forthcoming. My
	captivity forced me to understand and even empathize
	with Gerry Schnauz. My survival depended on it. I see
	now the value of such insight, for truly to pursue
	monsters we must understand them, we must venture into
	their minds. Only in doing so do we risk letting them
	venture into ours.

Mulder: (putting ball under Scully's nose) Smell that. (she

	Vineyard... ride your bikes down to the beach...
	eat baloney sandwiches... The only place you had to be
	on time was home for dinner. Never had to lock your
	door... no modems, no faxes, no cell phones --
Scully: Mulder, if you had to do without a cell-phone for two
	minutes you'd lapse into catatonic schizophrenia.
Mulder: You know, Scully, you don't know me as well as you
	think you do. My work demands that I live in a big
	city, but if I had to settle down, build a home, it'd
	be a place like this.

	"The X-Files: Home"

Scully: Imagine all a woman's hopes and dreams for her child,
	and then nature turns so cruel. What must a mother go
	through?
Mulder: Apparently not much in this case, if she'd just throw
	it out with the trash.
Scully: I...I guess I was just projecting on myself.
Mulder: Why? Is there a history of genetic abnormalities in
	your family?
Scully: No.
Mulder: Well, just find yourself a man with a spotless genetic
	makeup and a really high tolerance for being second
	guessed and start pumping out the little Uberscullies.
Scully: What about your family?
Mulder: "Hmm? (Scully nods) Well, (he smiles) aside for the
	need for corrective lenses and the tendency to be
	abducted by extraterrestrials involved in an

Scully: (reading from her prepared statement) I left behind a
	career in medicine to become an FBI agent four years
	ago, because I believed in this country. Because I
	wanted to uphold its laws, to punish the guilty and to
	protect the innocent. I still believe in this country,
	but I believe there are powerful men in the government
	who do not. Men who have no respect for the law and who
	flout it with disparity. I have come to the conclusion
	that it is no longer possible for me to carry out my
	duties as an FBI agent....
Senator: Are you tendering your resignation Agent Scully? Is
	that what you're trying to say?
Scully: No sir. What I AM saying is that there is a culture of
	lawlessness that has prevented me from doing my job.
	That the real target of this commitee's investigation
	should be the men who are beyond prosecution and
	punishment. The men whose secret policies are behind
	the crimes that you are investigating.
Senator: Either you tell us what you know about Agent Mulder's
	whereabouts or you will be held in contempt of congress

	most conservative scientists and science journals are
	calling for the exploration of Mars and Jupiter, with
	every reason to believe that life and the persistence
	of it is thriving outside our own terrestrial sphere.
	If you cannot get past this, then I suggest that this
	whole committee be held in contempt for ignoring
	evidence that cannot be refuted.

(Scully's closing monologue as she types her report):
Although cleared of any wrong doing in the deaths of Amy and
David Cassandra, Agent Mulder still has no recollection of the
events that led to their deaths. His seizures have subsided,
with no evidence of permanent cerebral damage, but I'm 
concerned that this experience will have a lasting effect.
Agent Mulder undertook this treatment hoping to lay claim to
his past. That by retrieving memories lost to him, he might
finally understand the path he's on. But if that knowledge
remains elusive, and if it's only by knowing where he's been,
that he can hope to understand where he's going, then I fear
Agent Mulder may lose his course. And the truths he is seeking
from his childhood will continue to evade him, driving him more
dangerously forward in impossible pursuit.

Section Chief Blevins: Agent Scully, please have a seat. Agent
	Scully, we've had a brief discussion, but will you
	restate the matter we're here to put to rest?
Scully: Yes sir. Four years ago, Section Chief Blevins assigned
	me to a project you all know as the x-files. As I am a
	medical doctor with a background in hard science, my
	job was to provide an analytical perspective on the
	work of Special Agent Fox Mulder, whose investigations
	into the paranormal were fuelled by a personal belief
	that his sister had been abducted by aliens when he was
	twelve. I come here today, four years later, to report
	on the illegitimacy of Agent Mulder's work. That it is
	my scientific opinion, that he became over the course
	of these years a victim, a victim of his own false 
	hopes and of his belief in the biggest of lies.
